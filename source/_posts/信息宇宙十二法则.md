## Twelve Laws of the Infocosm信息宇宙十二法则

### 1.

The Law of Scarcity: Scarcities are measurable and end at zero availability. They constrain an economic model to arrive at a calculable determined result. Economics as a science of scarcity justifies and enables the negative repressions of life after capitalism.

稀缺法则：稀缺是可衡量的，并在可用性为零时结束。它们限制了经济模型以得出可计算的确定结果。作为一门关于稀缺的科学，经济学为资本主义后的生活中的负面压抑提供了合理性和可能性。



### 2.

The Law of Abundance: Abundances are ultimately incalculable, and end in a near zero price that escapes economics entirely. As abundances become more vast and vital—like air, water, and silicon—they become externalities, economically invisible. They promise a positive path for life after capitalism.

丰饶法则：丰饶是无法计算的，最终以接近零的价格结束，完全超出经济学的范畴。随着丰饶变得更加广泛和重要，比如空气、水和硅，它们变成了经济上看不见的外部性。它们为资本主义后的生活提供了积极的道路。



### 3.

The Law of Wealth: Wealth is knowledge. Material atoms and molecules are infinite and in Brownian motion. Only truths can be stable and sustainable.

财富法则：财富即知识。物质的原子和分子是无限的，处于布朗运动中。只有真理才能稳定和可持续。



### 4.

The Law of Knowledge and Time: Beyond time, all is known and determined. The moving curtain of time is what forces new learning and measures it in knowledge.

知识与时间之法：超越时间，一切皆已知晓与决定。时间的流动帷幕促使新的学习，并以知识来衡量之。



### 5.

The Law of Money: Money is time, tokenized for fungible use across an economy of transactions.

货币法则：货币是时间，以代币化形式在交易经济中实现可互换使用。



### 6.

The Centrifuge of Knowledge: To grow, knowledge needs power. As knowledge is dispersed, so must power be dispersed to increase wealth.

知识的离心机：要成长，知识需要力量。随着知识的传播，财富的增长也需要力量的分散。



### 7.

The Law of Growth: Growth is learning, gauged by learning curves. This learning is measured by time saved and is falsifiable or monetizable by markets.

增长法则：增长就是学习，通过学习曲线来衡量。这种学习是通过节省时间来衡量的，并且可以通过市场来验证或者货币化。



### 8.

The Paradox of Capitalism: You can only keep what you give away. Savings are only valuable to the extent they are invested and given in collaboration with others.

资本主义的悖论：你只能保留你所给予的。储蓄只有在与他人合作的情况下进行投资和给予时才有价值。



### 9.

The Law of Information: Information is surprise, defined by Claude Shannon as “entropy.” It is the opposite of order, regularity, and pattern, which provide low-entropy carriers for high-entropy information, platforms for creativity.

信息法则：信息是惊喜，由克劳德·香农定义为“熵”。它是秩序、规律和模式的反义词，为高熵信息提供低熵载体，为创造力提供平台。





### 10.

Hirschman’s Law of Creativity: Creativity always comes as a surprise to us. If it didn’t, we wouldn’t need it and government planning would work.

赫希曼的创造力定律：创造力总是让我们感到惊喜。如果不是这样的话，我们就不需要它，政府的规划就会奏效。





### 11.

Thiel’s Law of Monopoly: All businesses seek monopoly and succeed to the degree that they achieve it. Innovation is zero-to-one. Once it is created, it can be propagated one-to-“n” across time and space.

蒂尔的垄断法则：所有企业都追求垄断，并在实现垄断程度上取得成功。创新是从零到一。一旦创造出来，它可以在时间和空间上以一对“n”的方式传播。



### 12.

The Law of the Hierarchical Universe: Humans are creators in the image of their Creator.

宇宙等级法则：人类是按照他们的造物主的形象创造者。
